Hi! I am Benjamin Oda, or Benjiro Oda if you happen to know me by that name. I am a primarily Java developer, however recently I have been dipping my toes into the world of C# and .NET infrastructure, and as such have learned what a quality language is.

This profile is mostly set up as a personal project hub for myself, and for that reason you won't find much impressive here. 

If you found yourself here as a result of searching for me (somehow) or through my website/linkedin, please email me with the email attached to my profile and we can discuss further,
  as well as I can direct you to the actually good looking projects I have.

Languages:
- Java
- C++
- Lua
- Luau
- C
- VB
- C#
- .NET
- ASP.NET
- Unity
- And probably many others I genuinelly cannot be bothered to list because:
    a) Nobody cares
    b) Nobody cares
